    <h1>JS Tutorials: The Console @VisualStudio2019</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio, developed by Windows, is a popular text editor and IDE, which is used and trusted by coders around the world. It offers a wide variety of languages, features, themes, and more, just what a coder needs to start coding! </p>
        <img src="https://docs.lagerdata.com/_images/vscode_launch_json.png" height="250px">
    <p>  Visual Studio can be installed through the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Download link</a>. Once set up, which can be done by following the instructions in the downloader, you can start your own project by creating a new folder, either through file explorer or through VSCode itself.
    </p>
    <p>This tutorial is gonna be covering JavaScript, a very useful language that is used for various websites, web apps, applications, and more. In this Beginner tutorial, we're gonna be learning to make a console web app.</p>
    <h2>What is a Console?</h2>
    <p>A console is a command line interface which can ran your JavaScript codes through, and you can interact with.</p>
    <p>Open the console to see what we will be doing:
        (Hint: Right-click→ Inspect→ Console)
